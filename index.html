        I was born in the Netherlands in delft. I lived there until I was 6 and then moved to the U.S
        I am still bilingual in both Dutch and enlgish, but it has been a while so I don't think I can
        carry a conversation in dutch...

        with us. I still have my uncles parents Live in the Netherlands. My mothers parents live in california.

        It has been a long time since I wrote about myself so believe me when i say this is the hardest part of the assignment.
        I hope that despite how short this paragraph is, it will still be considered a unique one

        My favorite past times is playing Dungeons and Dragons. I love creating characters that are unusually powerful in a very specific aspect. along with powerful stats,
        I love creating an overly elaborate backstory for said character which usually ends up being several pages long.

        One of my other past times is video games. I have played almost every genere that is out there and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that
        <acronym title "Real Time Strategy ">RTS</acronym> games are my favorite. RTS games are game hat require you to move and manage multipule variables at the same time.
